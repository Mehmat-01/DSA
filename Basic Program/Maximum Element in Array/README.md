# 🧮 Find the Largest Element in an Array

## 📝 Problem Statement  
You are given an array `arr` of size `n`. Your task is to find and return the **largest element** in the array.

---

## 📥 Input  
- The first line contains an integer `n`, the size of the array.  
- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers, representing the array elements.

## 📤 Output  
- Print a single integer — the **largest element** in the array.

## ⏱️ Expected Time Complexity  
`O(n)` — where `n` is the size of the array.  
You only need to traverse the array once to find the largest element.

---

## ⚙️ Constraints  
`1 <= n <= 10^5`

`1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

`Time Limit: 1 sec`
