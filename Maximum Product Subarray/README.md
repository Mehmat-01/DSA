#[üí°152 LeetCode Problem: Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/description/)


Problem Statement:
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) that has the largest product, and return that product.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2, 3, -2, 4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2, 3] has the largest product = 6.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [-2, 0, -1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2, -1] is not a contiguous subarray.


Constraints:

1 ‚â§ nums.length ‚â§ 2 √ó 10‚Å¥

-10 ‚â§ nums[i] ‚â§ 10

The product of any subarray of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
